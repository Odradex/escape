# README
This is an educational project completed for an internship at ITechArt. The theme of the project is a site for renting game rooms. The user can choose the organization and the room for the reservation, as well as additional services such as drinks, food and technology. The site administrator can create new organizations and assign owners to them. Owners can manage rooms and reservations for their organizations.

The biggest challenge in the project was creating a calendar for administrators and organization owners that would allow them to view, modify, and create reservations (one-time or recurring) without reloading the page.

Some of the features that can be added to a project include an organization search field, a commentable organization page, and an alert system to remind users of upcoming reservations.
